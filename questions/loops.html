 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 *   Edit each one of the tests' code to make it pass. Each one has been
 *   set up for you, all you need to do is either *fix* the code or *write
 *   new code* to make it work.
 *
 *   Please don't edit the returns, that is how the tests run (where it says
 *   do not edit this line, I mean it). Those are the expected results though,
 *   which should give you some clue on how to write the code to make the test
 *   pass.

 * Any questions, hit me up on my email.
