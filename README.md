This is something we will use throughout the semester to test things we have
covered in class.

### How to use
Each `HTML` file in `/questions` has a set of tests in it using a really simple
testing function.

The objective is to solve each one of the use cases by filling in code above the
test.

Write your code -> refresh the HTML page -> see if you test passes -> repeat.

Do this for __all__ the `HTML` files.
